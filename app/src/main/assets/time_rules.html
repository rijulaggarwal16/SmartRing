<p align="justify" style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
While setting the time constraints, you must keep note of a few things:
<ul style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<li>1 day includes timings from 12:00 AM to 11:59 PM. For setting further time, switch to the next day.</li>
<br />
<li>Time intervals should not overlap. An interval is defined as the time gap mentioned in a single row, or any subsets. 2 profiles can't be assigned for a single time interval.</li>
<br />
<li>Don't make time intervals jump a day, i.e. make the end time before or equal to the start time.</li>
<br />
<li>You may choose a day to have the same settings as any other day. However, these days will not be bound to have the same changes, i.e. changes in the schedule of 1 day will not affect the other. (In short, it is a way to reduce the time to set a schedule, by using previous saved settings from other schedules)
</li>
<br />
<li>You may change a schedule any time.</li>
</ul>

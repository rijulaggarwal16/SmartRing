<p>Activating this feature will allow you to receive calls if someone needs to talk urgently. This feature will also work in 'No Call Silent' profile. All calls will be rejected, however if a caller attempts to call for the third time in 15 minutes, the call will get through. You can also activate any other feature along with this feature. So, activating white list will allow users in that list to bypass this rule.</p>
